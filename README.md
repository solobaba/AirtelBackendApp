The final app will be able to accept data requests, process them and return a result to the requester. The requests might be entered manually into the app, or sent via a network service. For requests entered manually, the result will be displayed on screen. For network requests, the result will be sent via the same service they were received. All actions in the app must be saved and allow for export to various formats, such as pdf, xls, sql, etc. The currently ongoing action should be available for view in real time. The main screen of the app should show the last few requests that were received by the app, their details and their status. The requests must be handled by a scheduler that can keep track of the requests so that they can be processed as soon as the network is back up.
